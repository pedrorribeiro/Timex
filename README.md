# Timex
Timed input


Timex is a linux-only function for timed inputs, it takes a prompt, which must be a string, and a timeout, in seconds. 
After the prompt is given the user has until timeout (provided by the user) to answer the input. Should the timer run 
out the function returns 5985, although this will change in future iterations of the function, and prints "Time is up!".
